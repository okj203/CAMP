## Background and Overview
CAMP is a language learning platform, which utilizes EdTech to support access to remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.
CAMP takes a two-step approach to language learning: 
* The first step entails ineractive learning materials, which were designed and curated based on multi-senses education theory to provide students a learning environment with maximized langauge exposure.
* The second step is one-on-one video calls, which build on and further cement the material covered in each lesson.

* Lessons: Introductional videos for each lesson followed by flash cards and worksheets.
* One on one sessions: Video calls upon completion of each lesson. Teachers will build on the concepts introduced
and evaluate if a student is prepared to move on to the following lesson. 

## Functionality & MVP

* Lessons will have instructional videos, flash cards, and worksheets. 
* Schedules will be a calendar that shows teachers availability. Students will be able 
to sign up for available times through Google Calendar API. 
* Search/dropdown will provide users with the ability to search for specific teacher, and a dropdown menu for lessons.
* Reviews will give users the ability to post reviews to a teacher's profile page. 

## Technologies & Technical Challenges

* CAMP is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node).
